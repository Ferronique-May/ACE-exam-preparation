## The why's of using Cloud Computing

Cloud computing improves other things + more (eg. backups, file sharing, etc) by making it:
- Faster
- Convenient
- Easier
- Cheaper 
- Of course there are additional features to spice things up


```
Cloud computing is the software that manages the hardware in data centers.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

* You have to be connected to the internet
* You will be using a Third Party's Hardware
* On-Demand & Self-service - Pay as you use
* Resource Pooling (No direct access to the underlying hardware)

## Cloud Computing exist in many forms of services namely:

* SaaS -> Software as a Service. Typical audience = ANYONE...
* PaaS -> Platform as Service. Typical audience = SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS ^-^
* IaaS -> Infrastructure as a Service. Typical audience = IT PROFESSIONALS, SysAdmin

# Cloud Deployment Options

## Public Cloud
* Computing resources are owned and managed by a third party. The idea of multitenency exists here.

## Private Cloud 

* Computing resources are for exclusive use of one organization
* Typically uses a private network for greater security

## Hybrid Cloud

* Computing on premises with public (and/or private cloud) infrastructure
* Communicating/Orchestrating between different deployments

## Multi-Cloud

* Combining cloud solutions from more than one cloud service provider

# Elastic/Serverless Computing

## Elastic Computing

* Having the ability to scale up and scale back down automatically depending on the needs of the service/application/etc

## Serverless Computing

* For Software Developers, serverless computing provides a way to urn code without even thinking about the physical server.

# SLA's

## Service Level Agreements in Cloud Computing

* Cloud service providers provide service level agreements that allow us to measure our high expectations of their service.
