# Why is Data Science important?

In summary:

* Make better decisions 
* Create smarter products/solutions
* Automate manual process

Data Science can be used to make **better decisions** in organizations using statistics to make informed and factual decisions.

Data Science can be used to **create smart applications** by using: 

* **Machine Learning** to create products that solve complex problems for ours users automatically. 

* **Anticipatory Design** to anticpate the needs of users, minimize the number of choices they need to make and provide them with a user experience custom tailored to their needs.

* Product **Telemetry data** to understand our customers, their preferences and their behavious and how they actually use our products so that we can improve the overall design and its operations.

Data Science can be used to **automate manal processes**. The benefits of doing this in an organization:

* Frees up employees to do more valuable task that are more meaningful and fulfilling.

* Reduces cost of human labour

* Reduces defects in the work that is typically caused by human error, lack of precision and lack of communication. 

# What is Data Science? 

Data Science is and inter-disciplinary field consisting of: 
* Computer Science 
* Math and Statistics
* Domain Knowledge

that seeks to drive insight from data. 

The Goal of Data Science: Tranfrom data into knowledge to make rational decisions so that we can take action that hellps us achive our goals. Transform data into actionable insights. 

Common Skills of a Data Scientist:

* Programming Computers (Using programming languages - SQL, Python, R)
* Working with data (Collecting, cleaning, transforming)
* Creating and interpreting descriptive statistics that is numerically analysing data
* Creating and interpreting data visualizations (visually analysing)
* Creating statistical models
* Handling Big data
* Automating decision making processes using Machine Learning Algorithms
* Deploying data science solutions into production or communicating results to a wider audience.
